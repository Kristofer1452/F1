# 31.05.2023-Tagurpidi-F1

This code will simulate a race of F1 and put the results into a .txt file.
This reporsitory will contain a code which we wrote by ourselves, a file with instructions, the result.txt file, a code which we wrote with the teacher, a code that reads the same data from the txt file that the core we wrote ourselves shows on the console and what the code that we wrote with the teacher shows on the console
So the final code will basically show the best times, races and names on the console, as do the main codes that also generate the data.
